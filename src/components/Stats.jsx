                  amiable school facilities designed creatively to enable our
                  children to enjoy learning and develop interests and talents.
                  Being in a metropolitan area, we embrace an abundance of
                  cultures, traditions and celebrations to celebrate diversity
                  and inclusivity. We celebrate each childâ€™s individual
                  uniqueness, potential, possibilities and capabilities and
                  support their intellectual, emotional and social growth and
                  development in all areas throughout their learning journey.
                  Since inception in 2022, we have enjoyed warm friendships and
                  collaborations from our Tangara parents and guardians,
                  financial supporters, private education trainers, the Ministry
                  of Education, our community members among other stakeholders.
                  Together, we have made remarkable progress in supporting the
                  Government efforts to improve the education outcomes in our
                  community. Our stakeholders have made contributions ranging
                  from support supervision, funding, and capacity building among
                  others; all in support of SDG 4 Inclusive education for all.
                  To all of you our friends, we say Asante sana. We extend this
                  call to you to collaborate with us by supporting our
                  individual programs or if a parent enrolling your child to be
                  part of this wholesome educational experience, which
                  identifies and nurtures a million dreams. Karibu, Winifred
